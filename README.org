* Checkprint library
A library to simplify making PDFs that can be printed onto pre-printed
checks for an accounting system.
** Early software
This software works with one type of Quickbooks compatible check and
is not yet full featured.
** Prerequisites
Requires fpdf2.  pip install fpdf2

Requires my modification of the num2words library.  
https://github.com/veterinarian/num2words.git
** Usage - to be determined. For now you can 
import checkprint

pdf = checkprint.makepdf(payee,amount,date,[memo])
# date should be a string like "3/13/2017"
pdf.output('output.pdf', 'F')
